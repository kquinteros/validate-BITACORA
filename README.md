# Snakemake Workflow README

## Overview

This repository contains a Snakemake workflow designed to automate the execution of a bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Please note that this README assumes you have already installed the necessary dependencies and tools for running the workflow.

## Workflow Description

The Snakemake workflow is structured to perform the following tasks:

1. **Interproscan**: *Run interproscan to validate BITACORA output has correct PFAM domain.*
2. **Task 2**: *Description of task 2.*
3. **Task 3**: *Description of task 3.*

Each task is defined as a rule in the Snakemake file (`Snakefile`), and the workflow manages the dependencies between rules to ensure proper execution.

## Prerequisites

Before running the workflow, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Snakemake**: You can install Snakemake using the package manager of your choice (e.g., `pip install snakemake`).
- **Other Dependencies**: Make sure you have all the necessary tools and libraries installed for the specific tasks in your workflow. Refer to the documentation for each tool to install them.

## Usage

To execute the workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Edit Configuration**: If needed, modify the configuration file (`config.yaml`) to customize input paths, parameters, and other settings.

3. **Run the Workflow**: Execute the Snakemake workflow using the following command:

    ```bash
    snakemake --use-conda
    ```

    Replace `--use-conda` with `--use-singularity` or other relevant options depending on your environment.

4. **Monitor Progress**: Snakemake will display progress and information about executed rules in the terminal. Monitor this information to ensure the workflow is running as expected.

## Additional Notes

- **Customization**: Feel free to customize the workflow by modifying the `Snakefile` or adding additional rules to suit your analysis requirements.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the individual rule descriptions in the `Snakefile` for more details on each task.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter any issues, check the error messages in the terminal for guidance. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
